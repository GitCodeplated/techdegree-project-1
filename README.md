## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front end web development Personal Profile Page project.

[Project 1 - Project 1: Personal Profile ](https://techdegree-project-1.vercel.app/experience.html) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

For this project, I practiced web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I modified the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, two extra web pages and a stylish design.

 This was a great way to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gave me a web based platform to use as a personal online calling card to advertise my experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.

## Advantage

I also practice using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.
